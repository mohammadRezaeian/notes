**Scenario**: I wanna control / access my **comp1** (which **runs Linux**) from my **comp2** (which **runs MacOS**).
**Reason**: I cannot work with Data Science's stuff with **comp2** (Mac M1) whereas **comp1** has everything (Linux, GPU,...)

::: warning

Two computers must be connected to the same network!

## Control visually

I use **[NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/)** (I think it's faster and more controllable than TeamViewer).

::: hsbox Some useful settings

Go into **Server settings** > **Security**

- Tick "Blank the physical screen when somebody connects" (It helps turn off the controlled screen)
- **File transfers** section: tick /modify "Automatically save files in"

## Connect via SSH

👉 I learned from [this answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/1108044/248456).

❇️ On the "server computer" (**comp1** -- **Linux**)

```bash
# Knowing its name
hostname
# or `hostnamectl` or `cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname`
# mine: pop-os

# Knowing current user
whoami
# mine: thi
# You must know the password!!!

# Install openssh-server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server

# Check comp1's ip
ifconfig | grep "192.168"
# mine: 192.168.1.115
```

**Test**: connect from **comp1** to **comp1** itself!

```bash
ssh 127.0.0.1
# type user1's password
```

❇️ On the "client computer" (**comp2** -- **MacOS**)

```bash
# Connect via comp1's name
ssh thi@pop-os.local
# Type thi's password

# Connect via comp1's ip
ssh thi@192.168.1.115
```

❇️ Disconnect

```bash
exit
```

❇️ Copy files

```bash
# From client to remote
scp thi@pop-os.local:/home/thi/Downloads/file.pdf .

# From remote to client
scp file.pdf thi@pop-os.local:/home/thi/Downloads/
```

**Tip**: You can use a smtp client (eg: [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)) to make things visually

```bash
# server
pop-os.local # or using ip address
# port 
22
# username
thi
# password
```



## Open Jupter Notebook running on comp1

👉 Note: [Docker](/docker/)
👉 Note: [SSH](/ssh/)

Suppose that there is a jupyter lab server which is running on **comp1** (In my case, it's running inside a docker container which is ported to **comp1** via port `8888`). 

```bash
# On comp2
ssh -N -L localhost:8888:127.0.0.1:8888 thi@pop-os.local
# Remark: keep the terminal 
```

Then open http://localhost:8888/lab to see the result!



## SSH to the docker container inside comp1

I wanna ssh to the container which is running on **comp1** from **comp2**.

❇️ Suppose that the running container on **comp1** is created from an ==image which hasn't set up the open-ssh by default==. **We will set up a server in the running container**,

```bash
# Check the name of running container
docker ps # mine: docker_ai

# Go inside the running container
docker exec -it docker_ai bash

# [in the container]

# Install ssh server
apt update && apt install openssh-server && apt install nano
# Change `root`'s password
passwd # suppose: qwerty

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# and add
Port 2222
PermitRootLogin yes

# Restart ssh server
/etc/init.d/ssh start
```

In the `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
# expose the ports
ports:
	- "6789:2222"
```

```bash
# Test on comp1
ssh -p 6789 root@localhost
# enter "qwerty" password for "root"

# Connect from comp2
ssh -p 6789 root@pop-os.local
# enter "qwerty" password for "root"
```

❇️  In case your image ==has already installed `openssh-server` but forgot to run it by default==. We will run the ssh server on port `22` for the running container.

::: hsbox The codes in `Dockerfile` which are used to install and set up `openssh-server`

```bash
RUN apt-get install -y openssh-server
RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
RUN echo 'root:qwerty' | chpasswd
RUN sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# SSH login fix. Otherwise user is kicked off after login
RUN sed 's@session\s*required\s*pam_loginuid.so@session optional pam_loginuid.so@g' -i /etc/pam.d/sshd
# need?
ENV NOTVISIBLE "in users profile"
RUN echo "export VISIBLE=now" >> /etc/profile
# Export port ssh
EXPOSE 22
```

:::

Add below line to `Dockerfile` if you wanna run the openssh-server by default

```bash
CMD $(which sshd) -Ddp 22
```

::: warning

We shouldn't (cannot??) run 2 servers in parallel in the docker image (for example, one for jupyter notebook on port `8888` and one for `openssh-server` on port `22`).

💡 In this case, you should keep the jupyter notebook running. Each time you wanna run the `openssh-server`, you can run

```bash
docker exec docker_ai $(which sshd) -Ddp 22 # and keep this tab open
# or
docker exec -d .... # detach mode
```

You can also do this ==completely from **comp2**==,

```bash
ssh thi@pop-os.local
# Then you are in comp1's terminal
docker exec ....
```

**Important remark**: If you enter the container's shell and then you wanna exit with `exit` or `logout` command. It also terminates the server and you have to run the server again!

:::



::: info

Don't forget to forward the port `22` (in container) to `6789` in **comp1** via `docker-compose.yml`.

:::

```bash
# On comp1
docker exec <container_name> $(which sshd) -Ddp 22
# Keep this tab open and running
```

```bash
# On comp2
ssh -p 6789 root@pop-os.local
# enter pwd: "qwerty" as in the Dockerfile
```
