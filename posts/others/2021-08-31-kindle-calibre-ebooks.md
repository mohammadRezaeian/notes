My **personal note** for kindle devices. It contains mainly the "best for me" applications, some "not common" settings and several best practices.

__Fact__: I use Kindle Oasis.

ðŸ‘‰ [My reading list](/reading/).

## New ebook?

_Below way makes sure that your ebooks are in good format, stored and sync between your reading devices._

1. Ebook purchased with file / download.
2. Formated by [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) (add metada, cover,...).
3. Convertd to mobi (kindle format). In the convert window, choose **Page setup** and then choose your device.
4. Send to Kindle using [Send to Kindle app](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle). Drag and drop (converted) **mobi** files to the app.
5. Add to collection on [Amazon cloud](https://www.amazon.fr/hz/mycd/myx?ref=myk_mkmw_mig_FR#/home/content/pdocs/dateDsc/).
6. Sync to Kindle device.

## Other tips with Calibre

1. Choose a place to store ebooks, should be a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive (I used this) to use on different operation systems.
2. **Auto search & download metadata & cover**: Choose book/books > Right click and choose _Edit metadata_ > _Download metadata and covers_ > Then verify and save.
   - You can use [[cmd]] + [[D]].
   - You should change the name and author correctly for a better search.
3. **Modify metadata**: Choose a book (or list of books) > right click and choose *Edit metadata* > ...
    - You can search for a cover on the internet > Right click on this cover > Copy image > On Calibre, in _Edit metadata individually_, right click on current cover > _Paste cover_.
    - "Title" is for displaying in Kindle. "Title sort" is for being sorted in Calibre.
    - "Author" and "Author sort" should be "Tu Kim Tran" and "Tran, Tu Kim", for example.
4. **Quickly edit some field of a book**: just need to click 2 times on this field (not so fast).
