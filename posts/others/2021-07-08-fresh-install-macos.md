This is my personal list of to-do things for a new Macbook.

üëâ Note: [Ubuntu / Pop!\_OS fresh start](/fresh-installation-ubuntu/).
üëâ Note: [Windows fresh start](/fresh-install-windows/).
üëâ Note: [DS & ML with Mac M1](/getting-start-data-science-machine-learning-on-mac-m1/).

## **Check info**:

```bash
# Current version of MacOSX
sw_vers -productVersion

# Check if XCode Command Line Tools is installed
xcode-select --install
# Should return "/usr/bin/xcrun"
# If there is any problem, try to install XCode from App Store!

# check if running on ARM or Intel
arch
# arm64 -> ARM
# i386 -> Intel (running with Rosetta)
```

## **Keyboard & Trackpad settings**

Go to **Keyboard Settings** and then,

1. Should choose "U.S." instead of "U.S. International" because with the latter, we have underline score below special symbols like `"`
2. For Vietnamese input method, DON'T choose built-in VNese input options. Use ~~[GoTiengViet](https://www.trankynam.com/gotv/)~~ [EVKey](https://evkeyvn.com/) instead (Turn off _Gatekeeper_ before installing by `sudo spctl --master-disable`. Then check by `spctl --status` => should return `assessments disabled`)! (Because there will be unconfortable underline when we type).
   1. **Note 1**: If you are going to use Bitwarden (a password manager, recommended), it will prevent sometimes the input method to work normally (including GoTiengViet and EVKey). In this case, you have to turn off Bitwarden (or restart it). üëâ **Update 05 Nov 2021**: With MacOS 12.1 Beta, it doesn't have this error anymore!
   2. **Note 2**: EVKey works better than GoTiengViet (and it's still maintained) in some cases, for example, when you wanna type "th·ª≠ nghi·ªám" on the browser address bar, GoTiengViet gives "thu·ª≠ nghi·ªám" instead.

### **More keyboard settings**:

1. Touch Bar shows: **F1, F2, etc Keys**.
2. Press ... to: **Do Nothing**.
3. Press and hold ... to: **Show Control Srip**.
4. Tick on "Use F1, F2..."
5. Click on **Customize Control Strip** and change. Below are my customization.

   ```bash
   Brightness - Keyboard Brightness -- Media -- Volume -- Screen Lock -- Night Shift -- Screen Capture -- Dictation -- Siri
   ```

### Other useful keyboard tips

1. Map top-left keyboard to backslash/tilde symbols. Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) and setting up "non_us_backslash" to "grave_accent_and_tilde (`)". If you don't know the names of some keys, you can use installed Karabiner Viewer.
2. Three fingers to drag (choose texts): **System Preferences** > **Accessibility** > **Pointer Control** > **Trackpad Options...** > Enable dragging (three fingers drag).
3. Install [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) (and use [[‚åò]] + [[‚á•]] which replaces the default method on mac, be careful!!!) to switch between windows (instead of apps) like on Windows/Linux: `brew install --cask alt-tab`. Open its preferences (We wanna show windows only on the screen containing the cursor):
   - General > tick on "Start at login".
   - Controls > Show windows from: "Screen showing AltTab" (on the 3rd option).
   - Appearance > Show on "Screen including mouse".
4. **For external keyboard K380**: Download and install [Logitech Options](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options). Install this to use [[F]] keys by default. **Remark**: Don't open Bitwarden while using K380, otherwise, it won't work normally (for example, F keys).

## **Printers & Scanners**

1. Setting up **printers** (if available). You may need [Gutenprint](http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php) for an alternative driver for printers on chip M1. After installing the drivers, turn on your printer (connect to a common wifi or via an usb cable), then _System Preferences_ > _Printers & Scanners_ > Add printer and choose your own printer, don't forget to choose Gutenprint as driver!
2. For **scanner** app: you can use VueScan (paid) if the current version of app doesn't support chip M1 yet!
3. For **Canon MG2900** printer/scanner + apps: you may need to download and install drivers from [this site](https://brothersupportdownloads.blogspot.com/2020/06/canon-pixma-mg2900-scanner-driver.html). A backup files are [here](https://mega.nz/file/U0RwBR6T#qa50uOyhlAEiRtrMm_zBkXPtPufJD2Wa1gtbtkw5W_w). You may find other useful drivers for other types of printers on this site also.
   - Change to use black & white only (or color only): System Preferences > Printers & Scanners > Choose the printer > Options & Supplies > Utility > Open Printer Utility > Ink Cartridge Settings > Black Only.
4. **Scanner app**: use **Image Capture** (built-in app on Mac) or install **Canon IJ Scan Utility2**.

## **Finder**

1. Add necessary folder shortcuts to sidebar.
2. Add recycle Bin to sidebar: [[‚áß]] + [[‚åò]] + [[.]] to show hidden folders > drag **Bin** folder to sidebar > [[‚áß]] + [[‚åò]] + [[.]] to hide hidden folders again.
3. Customize some options in Preferences.
4. Show status bar: View > Show status bar.

### Copy files between Linux and MacOS

**Require**: the same wifi network!

1. **On MacOS**: System Preferences > Sharing > Tick on "File Sharing" > choose "Shared Folders" > on "Everyon", change to "Write & Read".
2. **On Linux**: Nautilus, click on "Other Locations" > "Networks" > choose the Macbook (and type macos profile password) > choose the shared folders in previous step > Exchange files/folders you want.

Disable Resume in Preview and QuickTime Player

```bash
defaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false
```

## **Screen recording**

üëâ Note: [Screen recording on MacOS](/screen-recording-on-macos/).

## **Dictionary**

- [Install Viettien](https://mega.nz/file/x0RgTbhK#1rz1mpsbXXxLmLs1blVk9zLEmI0d5FXk7Bora4Rm9Y0) (I use version 5.0b for Mac Big Sur chip M1). Alternative dictionaries can be downloaded from this link (I backed it up for personally using).
  1. Don't forget to open **Security & Privacy** and click on **Open anyway** many times!
  2. Another option is to install Tinhte's dictionary from this link, copy extracted folder (`Tinhe_anh-viet.dictionary`) to `/Users/thi/Library/Dictionaries/`.
  3. After installing successfully, open Dictionary app > Preferences... > Tick on the names which are corresponding to the installed/copied dictionaries.
  4. There are built-in LacViet dictionaries but they are not activated yet, don't forget them!
- **Goldendict**: download installation [here](https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict/wiki/Early-Access-Builds-for-Mac-OS-X) + dictionaries [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jna8_grA-wyhPrq8BiB7ypadvW3tTlIv).

## üêû **Errors**

1. After updating

      ```bash
      defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'; killall Dock
      ```

      Need to update _Xcode Command-line Tools_:

      ```bash
      # option 1
      xcode-select --install
      # output:
      xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
      ```

      ```bash
      # option 2 (if option 1 doesn't work)
      # Login + download from webpage
      https://developer.apple.com/download/more/
      ```

2. In case of error in installing Application with `App is Damaged Can‚Äôt Be Opened`

   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/App_Name.app
   ```

### Sidecar problems

Using Sidecar feature to turn your ipad to an external screen. It ==works normally with cable== (you have to "trust" from both sides each other). In the case you **cannot use Sidecar via wireless**,

1. Turn on Hardoff on both Mac (in General) and iPad (in General).
2. Turn on Bluetooth and Wifi (connect to the same network).
3. Turn off file sharing and VPN.
4. Reset network setting on your ipad (General > Reset > ...) > restat > connect again to the same network with your Mac > wait 2 minutes > try Sidecar again!
5. **Best practice**: Using sidecar via a usb cable! If using wifi, we have latency with mouse cursor!
6. For ones who using mac's usb-c port. A direct hub (with an lightning output to charge ipad) may not work (not sufficient power to charge ipad). However, usign another usb-dock and connect to the hub is working fine. Other words,
   - _Not working_: mac - hub - ipad.
   - _Working_: mac - hub - usb doc - ipad

## **External screens**

I use 2 external screens. However, chip Apple M1 doesn't support more than 1 external one. That's why we need an adapter (having DisplayLink technology) + to install DisplayLink driver for Mac.

- I use [this adapter](https://www.wavlink.com/en_us/product/WL-UG39DK1_White.html) (Wavlink's USB 3.0 Laptop Docking Station -- WL-UG39DK1) because it's the cheapest one I can find in France.
- [DisplayLink driver](https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/macos). Note that, sometimes it doesn't support the rotation screen.
- If you use a portable external screen like mine (Asus zenscreen), you have to use DisplayLink driver (and open it).

## Disable dark mode for specific app

```bash
# Use spotlight to find the name of the app, eg. "Calendar"
# Find the bundle identifier of this app by
osascript -e 'id of app "Calendar"'
# which returns: com.apple.iCal

# Turn off dark mode
defaults write com.apple.iCal NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool Yes
# Restore setting
defaults write com.apple.iCal NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool No

# Restart the app
```



## Other settings

1. Enable to install unknown softwares: Sometimes, you cannot install some app from the internet, just go to **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > There will be some warning line at below of "App Store and identified developers", just click "Open anyway"!

   - If you have some issue with `.dmg` file like "resource busy", open **Disk Utility**, then **Images** > **Verify...** > Choose the image file you cannot open then click "Verify"!

2. **Git**: install Gitkraken.

3. (Optional) Install [Hombrew](https://brew.sh/) (missing package control for mac).

   ```bash
   # after install, don't forget to add to PATH
   echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /Users/thi/.zprofile
   eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv) # refresh

   # problem with "old" cask
   # instead of
   brew cask something
   # use
   brew install --cask something
   ```

4. Add gap to Dock (use multiple times)

   ```bash
   defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'; killall Dock
   ```
