A note of an amateur who has recently bought a GoPro.



## üçø iMovie

### Use exHDD as a source of Library

1. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHGgrkJe1c&t=240s) (no need to copy to your Mac)
2. File > Open Library > New > Naming + save to exHDD
3. Choose the library > Create new event > Import media to it > Wait for it to finish.
4. Start creating video.



## üé¨ Final Cut Pro

### Misc

- **Library** = shared media between projects => mahny **projects** = inside Library.

###  Editing

- **üí°Keep storage in exHDD**:  When creating a new **Library**, choose **Leave files in place** (in the exHDD, for example) (so that we don't hurt the laptop's storage)
  - (After creating) Click on a library > (on the right panel) **Storage Location**.
    - ==Don't store your videos in the Library!==
    - ==Keep your caches somewhere that easy to find (and delete)==
- **Quick split**: Place the cursor at the point on timeline and then  [[B]] (Blade tool).
- **Quick delete**: select a backspace button ([[‚å´]]).
- **Selection**
  - **Range selection**: [[R]]
  - **Normal selection**: [[A]]

- **Quick trim**: [[‚å•]] + [[\[]] (Trim from current position of cursor to the end)
- **Fade in/out audio** ([ref](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/fade-audio-in-and-out-ver39580fed/mac)): Choose a audio section > Modify > Adjust Audio Fades > Tick on "Fade in" and "Fade out" > Apply Fades > There will be 2 "small buttons" for you to adjust the fades on timeline.

### Exporting

- **4K + mp4**: Fortmat (Computer) + Codec (H.264 Better Quality). You can also check the ffps, estimated file size.

###  üß∞ Accessories + things to buy

1. [GoPro HERO9 Black](https://gopro.com/en/us/). I chose to *buy a bundle* -- 350 EUR.
2. [Deyard Accessories Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Deyard-Accessories-Shockproof-Waterproof-Protector/dp/B08DKW63K8) (Shockproof Carry Bag + Waterproof Case + Tempered Glass Screen Protector + Silicone Cover + Snorkel Filter Bundle). -- 22 USD. **What I like from this**: A carry bag with a zip compartiment + Tempered Glass Screen Protector (for capturing under the water) + a silicon cap + a waterproof case + cheap price.
3. [HERO9 Black Dual Battery Charger + Spare Battery](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/mounts-accessories/hero9-black-dual-battery-charger-plus-spare-battery/ADDBD-001.html) (*goes with HERO9 bundle*). In total, I have **3 batteries**.
4. [Magnetic Swivel Clip](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/mounts-accessories/magnetic-swivel-clip/ATCLP-001.html) (*goes with HERO9 bundle*). It's useful if you wanna handle your gopro on a backpack.
5. **SD cards**: 1 [microSDXC SanDisk Extreme PRO 128 GB](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07G3H5RBT) (*SDSQXCY-128G-GN6MA*) + 2 [SanDisk Extreme 64 GB](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07FCMBLV6) (*SDSQXA2-064G-GN6MA*) + 1 [microSD Extreme SanDisk 32 GB](https://www.amazon.fr/microSD-Extreme-SanDisk-Performance-graphiques/dp/B089M5KV4Y/) (*goes with HERO9 bundle*, *SDSQXAF-032G-GN6GN*). **Tip**: you should check the official [list of supported SD cards](https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/SD-Cards-that-Work-with-GoPro-Cameras/ta-p/394308) from GoPro website. **Remember**, the type of card is really important, otherwise, your footages cannot be saved correctly.
6. **An external HDD**: [WD - My Passport for Mac 4TB](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07VTNW4ZQ) -- 130 EUR. Used to store your videos. **Tip**: you should format your drive into *exFAT* so that Windows, MacOS and Android can recognize it. On MacOS, you can use built-in *Disk Utilities* app, on Windows, you can use a free edition of [MiniTool Partition Wizard](https://www.partitionwizard.com/) to format the drive.
7. (Optional) **An card reader/adapter**: [TUTUO USB C card reader](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B01M35UYVA/) -- 13 EUR. It's useful if you wanna copy videos from SD cards to external HDD using an android tablet. I use it with Galaxy Tab S7+. **Tip**: if you wanna buy another adapter, you should buy one with [OTG support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go).
8. (Optional) **An AIO tripod**, I used [AuyKoo Perche √† Selfie Tr√©pied](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B08PCRHCDL) -- 25 EUR. It's better than [The Handler](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/mounts-accessories/the-handler/AFHGM-003.html) (goes with the bundle) in case we it has a tripod and you can extend the high. **Note**, if you bought a gimbal with a tripod like Inkee Falcon below, you don't have to buy this tripod.
9. **A Gimbal**: It's difficult to find a gimbal for HERO9 because this GoPro version goes with HyperSmooth 3.0 which is really better to stabilize without a Gimbal. However, in the real world, it's not so good, especially when you move up/down. **The only gimbal** which suits to HERO9 I've found is [INKEE Falcon](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005002660579182.html) -- 74 EUR. I bought it from AliExpress.
10. (If you're rich) [Quark Stabilizer 2](https://noirmatter.com/products/quark-stabilizer)

### üí° Tips

1. Don't record a *very-long-and-boring* videos, record moments and use a video editor (like iMovie) to merge them later.
2. **Travel** with not many SD Cards?
   1. Use around 1x32GB + 2x64GB + 1x128GB.
   2. Record only moments.
   3. A tablet to be a bridge where we can use it to copy videos from SD to exHDD.
   4. HDD formated in exFAT.
3. **Where to store**?
   1. **Option 1** : Google Photos. **I don't like**: limit to 2TB (you can buy more when you reach it but it's expensive) + expensive + difficult to manage video album + cannot share private videos to embed in a website + cannot share to youtube. **I like**: I use it as a photo backup (started from the time Google allow us to upload unlimitedly) + powerful to search your album/photos/videos.
   2. **Option 2** (I use) : exHDD. I use WD Passport 4TB + Toshiba 2TB.
   3. **Option 3** (I use) : Upload video to Youtube and set to private or ublisted. Be careful on the audio you use in the video. **Note**: the videos you saved on Youtube can be deleted without any reason!
   4. **Option 4** (I use) : GoPro Plus. **I like**: unlimited + keep your original footages + goes with many options including offering 2 free replacement cameras for your gopro + you can share your video to youtube/facebook in background. **I don't like**: take longer to upload + cannot make album + cannot share as embedded + the management system is bad.

### üêû Fix things

#### MacOS cannot recognize SD Card?

``` bash
The operation can‚Äôt be completed because one or more required items can‚Äôt be found.
```

Just Force to quit Finder and relaunch it.

#### Flicker problems

For example, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIQKp4g9sAE). $\Rightarrow$ Choose **PAL** settings (50fps) instead of NTSC.
